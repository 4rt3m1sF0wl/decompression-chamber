### AKA DecoCha
Repository for the Decompression Repair Project, eventually it will be assembled into a single application that can be run with no fanagaling but needs to be built first

This code is a program that redraws compressed images into higher quality images by color blobbing. It is intended for graphic designs and drawn images that are pulled from the internet and are of unfit quality for use in other applications
It is a project for my Mom, as she pulls or recieves images from the internet that are of low quality, and has to redraw them by hand, all so she can print them out for teachers/students who need them. It's an obscene amount of work that she is always occupied with, so this means to correct that.
